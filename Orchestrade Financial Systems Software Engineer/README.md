# Technical Phone Interview
- The phone interview was 45 minutes long.
- I was asked to code this in Google Docs so I could not run my code

## 1. Technical Questions
-----
- What is deadlock
- What can you not do with a class with private constructor
- What is finally block
- How does hashmap work
- What should be a concerns when you are designing the hashmap
- Differnce between deep copy and shallow copy


## 2. Coding and Debugging Round
-----

### 1. Debug Hash function
What is wrong in the below code:    

	public override int GetHashCode(List<string> listA, bool isA){

			return IsA.GetHashCode()*31 + listA.GetHashCode();
	}



### 2. Is the String Duplicate?
- Write a function to see if there is any duplicate character in the string.    
- The string will contain only ascii characters.        
- The function should have a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1).     
	 


### 3. What's Wrong in Parallel Computing
- `ConcurrentDictionary` is a Dictionary which is thread safe.
- `DoCompute` function is costly.
- What is wrong in the below code when multiple threads execute `Compute` function at the same time:

		
		ConcurrentDictionary<ComputeParams, double> _resultCache = new ConcurrentDictionary<ComputeParams, double>();

		public double Compute(ComputeParams params){

			double result;
			if (_resultCache.TryGetValue(params, out result)) return result;
			var result = DoCompute(params);
			_resultCache[params] = result;
			return result;
		}
		 
		double DoCompute(ComputeParams params){

				// calculate
		}
