# Round-1 Coding Phone Interview

- The interview was 45 minutes long.   
- First 15 minutes he asked me about my background.   
- I was provided a coderpad link to solve the coding problem.   


## 1. Background questions
---------
- Why are you interested in this position
- What are your primary languages
- Rate yourself in Spark
- Rate yourself in Java
- What are threads
- How can you make threads talk to each other in Java
- How can you avoid race condition when you are dealing with threads in Java


## 2. FourSum
---------
Given an array of integers `arr` and a number `s`, write a function `fourSum()` that finds index of those numbers in `arr` that sum up to `s`.  
Your function should return an array of index of these numbers in an ascending order.    


	Input: 
		arr = [2, 7, 4, 0, 9, 5, 1, 3]
		s = 20
		
	Output: 
		[1, 2, 3, 4]
	
	Explanation: 
		arr[1] + arr[2] + arr[3] + arr[4] = 7 + 4 + 0 + 9 = 20

		
- What is the time complexity of the program ?
- What is the space complexity of the program ?
