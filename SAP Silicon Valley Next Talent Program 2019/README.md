## 1. Search Index or Insert Position
---------
Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You may assume no duplicates in the array.
		
## 2. Move Zeroes
-----
Given an array `arr`, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

		Example:

		Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
		Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

## 3. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree
-----

Given a n-arry tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
